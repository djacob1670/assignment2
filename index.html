		The ripple effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States has resulted in more than lost lives. The issue of food insecurity also ballooned as more people became unemployed and dealt with greater financial uncertainty.

		As some in the U.S. resist efforts to contain the virus, COVID-19 has flourished as a result. With President-elect Joe Biden set to take office in January, he has vowed to contain the pandemic. But if and when COVID-19 is subdued, multiple other crises like the issue of food insecurity will require his attention as well.
